# Model-Serializer

This is a system created by zblox164. It shows how a object serializer would be made in the simplest form.

It does not just clone models from replicated storage and place them down on the plot like a regular sandbox tycoon. Instead, it recreates the children of each model, groups them, and then places them down on the plot. This means you can create a model, place it on your plot, leave the game, delete the model from the game entirely and have it still load the model(s).
